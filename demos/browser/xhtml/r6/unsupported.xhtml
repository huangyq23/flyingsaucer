      <span id="pagebyline">Unsupported Features</span>

      <p>Flying Saucer R6 has support for most of the features of CSS 2.1. The only major thing missing is support
for shrink-to-fit and table layout is not fully supported. This means you must explicitly set widths on
your divs if you don't want them to stretch to fill 100% of the available space.
There are also lots of bugs that remain to be stamped out. Certain combinations of features may
result in strange behavior. We encourage you to report any bugs you find to the mailing
list and we will work hard to fix them. Our goal is 100% spec compliance.</p>
