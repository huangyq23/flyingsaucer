h1. Flying Saucer Supported Features from CSS 2.1

_Note: this page is currently being re-worked with the advent of our R7 release, which covers most of the CSS 2.1 specification. If you have questions about our support for specific features, please contact us on our mailing list. Thanks!_

Flying Saucer supports the bulk of the strict XHTML and CSS 2.1 standards. We are working towards complete (and correct) feature support of these standards, but not everything works yet. Most of it is there, though.

h3(fs_heading){clear:none}. General XHTML / CSS features

* Formatted text: basically everything: paragraphs and spans, bold, italic, font sizes, text alignment, horizontal alignment, different fonts
* Box model: border, padding, margin, colors, background images, styled borders
* Full positioning support: static, relative, absolute, and fixed, and floats. 
* Tables: Table support is currently being rewritten so check on the mailing list to see what works.
* Forms: Every standard form control is represented. There are still some bugs with alignment.
* Images: both as inline images with the <img> tag and with background images.
* :hover styles for (dynamic) rollover effects
* Anchors, both external and in-document
* Lists: lists with proper positioning and
* CSS selectors. All CSS selectors in the spec should be supported, even the sibling/child ones
* Pagination
* Margin Collapsing
* R7pre1: Shrink-to-fit sizing. Turned on for auto-width floats, inline-blocks, and absolutely positioned content.
* R7pre1: min-width, max-width, min-height, and max-height properties, for non-replaced content only.

h3(fs_heading){clear:none}. Special Features

* Speed. We are fast enough to render all of Hamlet (the play, not the dish) in under 4 seconds on a 1.5 GHZ Pentium. We are working to improve speed and memory usage all the time.
* Embedded fonts. You can embed a truetype font in your application (in the jar file), and use it in pages rendered in your application.
* Render direct to PDF. You can create PDF documents directly from XML/CSS or XHTML/CSS, and even use the print media type in CSS to control margins. Using a couple of custom properties described in our User's Guide, you can even create headers and footers.

h3(fs_heading){clear:none}. What's not Supported (yet)

* Parts of absolute, fixed, and float positioning. Things like setting a left and right with width = auto. 
* Shrink-to-fit sizing. You need an explicit width on any positioned for floated box. (in R7pre1)
* Auto-fit tables. You must use explicit table widths and sizes (%,px, em, etc).
* Incremental rendering and dynamic layout

There are undoubtedly many bugs as well. If you find one please report it to us.

Thanks!
